# LED-5050-RGB

This is the Altium Designer library I have made for SMD 5050 RGB LED.
You can directly use LED RGB 5050.IntLib file. I have also included .SchLib and .PcbLib files.

NOTE : The datasheet of LED I used is included. Please check pinouts of the LED you are using.
       It is likely that the pinouts may be different. Please make suitable changes in .SchLib file.
